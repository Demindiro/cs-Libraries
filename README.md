What are these libraries?
=========================

These libraries are used in some of my projects. They contain some functionality
I imagine would be useful in a multitude of projects, hence they are separate
projects.


Why are they all in one repository? Doesn't that make things messy?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I guess it would indeed be a better idea to keep them separated, but on the other
hand it is also nice to be able to pull all depencies of a project with one command.
